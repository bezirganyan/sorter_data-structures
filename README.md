# Sorting Algorithms
## Description
This is a library which implements common sorting algorthms in C++:
* [Selection Sort](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/selection_sort_algorithm.htm)
* [Bubble Sort](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/bubble_sort_algorithm.htm)
* [Insertion Sort](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/insertion_sort_algorithm.htm)
* [Merge Sort](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/merge_sort_algorithm.htm)
* [Quick Sort](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/quick_sort_algorithm.htm)

## What it can do
This library can sort your unsorted array for any amount of elements by using
one of the Sorting algorithms described above. It also gives an option to get
the time spent on sorting, so you can compare the algorithms.

## Live Demo
Live demo is included for testing and educational purposes. To build and
run the demo you simply need to enter `make` command in your bash or command
prompt. That will build the live demo, which you can run with `./demo`command.
To remove demo and other build files, you need to enter `make clean` command.
Note that `make clean` will *not* remove any source file.
